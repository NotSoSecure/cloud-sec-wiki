## Books

* [Pentesting Azure Applications: The Definitive Guide to Testing and Securing Deployments](https://www.amazon.in/Pentesting-Azure-Applications-Definitive-Deployments-ebook/dp/B072SS34CP/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1536010588&sr=8-1)
* [Penetration Testing Azure for Ethical Hackers](https://www.packtpub.com/product/penetration-testing-azure-for-ethical-hackers/9781839212932)

## Tools

### Offensive

* [azucar](https://github.com/nccgroup/azucar): Security auditing tool for Azure environments
* [cs-suite](https://github.com/SecurityFTW/cs-suite): One stop tool for auditing the security posture of AWS/GCP/Azure infrastructure.
* [onedrive_user_enum](https://github.com/nyxgeek/onedrive_user_enum): enumerate valid onedrive users
* [MicroBurst](https://github.com/NetSPI/MicroBurst): MicroBurst includes functions and scripts that support Azure Services discovery, weak configuration auditing, and post exploitation actions such as credential dumping. It is intended to be used during penetration tests where Azure is in use. 
* [ROADtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ROADtools): ROADtools is a framework to interact with Azure AD. It currently consists of a library (roadlib) and the ROADrecon Azure AD exploration tool.
* [AzureADRecon](https://github.com/adrecon/AzureADRecon): AzureADRecon is a tool which extracts and combines various artefacts like Tenant, Users, Licenses, ServicePrincipals, etc. out of an Azure AD environment with a valid credential.

### Defensive

- [Azure Policy Compliance Scan](https://github.com/Azure/policy-compliance-scan): With the Azure Policy Compliance Scan action, you can now easily trigger a on demand scan from your GitHub workflow on one or multiple resources, resource groups or subscriptions, and continue/fail the workflow based on the compliance state of resources.
